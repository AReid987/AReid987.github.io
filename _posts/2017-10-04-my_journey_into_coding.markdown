	For me, an interest in technology began at a very young age. Because my father was in the Air Force, I grew up spending time in the computer rooms of various military bases. Like many kids, I eagerly wanted to do whatever the adults around me were doing. At that age, computers were a fascinating enigma to me. I would witness the adults puzzling over what seemed like an endless array of problems that would arise and then working together to solve them. This would become the genesis of my intrigue. 
	
	As a teenager, I played videogames, used AOL instant messanger and had very basic computer classes in school. I've always been the type to want to take things apart and put them back together in order to see how they worked. I loved model cars, legos, drawing up ideas for inventions - anything that was like a puzzle or involved problem solving. One area remained mysterious though : computers. I wanted to know how to take them apart and see what was going on in there! By the time I was in the 10th grade, I was heavily into playing music. Then I made a friend named Sunjay. He was also way into music. We started a band, which lead to us hanging out all the time. I started to realize he knew a lot about computers. He was a bit of a hacker as well. I picked up a few things from him, but the inner workings of computers would remain a mystery as my interest in music overshadowed everything else in my life. Around that time, I decided to make music my career.

  As a musician, computers were everything. Writing, recording, performing, promoting... everything a modern musicians needs to do involved the use of a computer. Eventually, I began to feel an insatiable desire to learn more about this great tool. I felt a bit disadvantaged that I didn't know more. Consequently, the software I use for music production, Ableton Live, has an API that is malleable. Using Max for Live, a visual programming language, a user is able to customize the functionality of the software in many ways. With this as a first step, my thirst for knowledge would continue to grow. The plethora of online educational resources provided further fuel in my technological pursuits. Eventually, I came to a revelation that a life in tech was right for me.
